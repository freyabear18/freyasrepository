                <p>Ally Carter is the pen name of <b>Sarah Leigh Fogleman</b> (born January 1, 1974), an American author of young adult fiction and adult-fiction novels that graduated from Oklahoma State University and Cornell University.</p>
                <p>Ally’s biography cites:</p>
                <p><i>"I was born and raised in Oklahoma.  My mother was a teacher and my father a farmer and rancher.  I have one older sister.</i></p>
                <p><i>In high school, I was very active in a number of student organizations and graduated as co-valedictorian of my senior class.  I then attended Oklahoma State University and Cornell University and worked for several years in the agricultural industry before writing full-time.</i></p>
                <p><i>My first novel, Cheating at Solitaire (Berkley) was published in 2005.  The following year I published the sequel to Solitaire, Learning to Play Gin.  There are no more plans for future books in that series at this time.</i></p>
                <p><i>My first novel for young adults, I’d Tell You I Love You but Then I’d Have to Kill You was published by Disney-Hyperion in April 2006.  Love You Kill You (as we call it) was followed by Cross My Heart and Hope to Spy (October 2007), Don’t Judge a Girl By Her Cover (June 2009), Only the Good Spy Young (June 2010), Out of Sight, Out of Time (March 2012).  United We Spy (September 2013) is the sixth–and final–Gallagher Girls novel.</i></p>
                <p><i>I am also the author of Heist Society (February 2010) and its sequels Uncommon Criminals (June 2011), and Perfect Scoundrels (February 2013), as well as a Christmas novella set in the Heist Society world: The Grift of the Magi (November 2016).
                </i></p>
                <p><i>In January 2013 I published the cross-over novella Double-Crossed that features characters from both the Gallagher Girls and Heist Society. It is available for free at spiesandthieves.com and wherever ebooks are sold.</i></p>
                <p><i>ALL FALL DOWN is the first book the Embassy Row series. It was published on January 20, 2015 and launched a new three-book series with Scholastic. SEE HOW THEY RUN was released December 22, 2015. The series will concluded with TAKE THE KEY AND LOCK HER UP which was released in the US in December 2016.</i></p>
                <p><i>My books have been published in more than twenty countries and have appeared on best-seller lists from the New York Times, USA Today, the Wall Street Journal, Barnes and Noble, IndieBound, and Bookscan. They have sold over two million copies in the United States.</i></p>
                <p><i>I am one of the luckiest people in the world, and today, I’m able to do the job I wanted to do when I was a kid, and I am back living in Oklahoma."</i></p>
