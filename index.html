                    <p>The Gallagher Academy for Exceptional Young Women is an institution founded by Gillian Gallagher in 1865 as means for young women to study espionage. The current headmistress is Rachel Morgan, and the school is located in a classified location. The adults in the outside, average world believe the Gallagher Academy to be a prestigious, all-girls school, while the local children view it as a preppy school for privileged snobs. Gallagher Girls are trained in martial arts, taught real espionage history, learn political secrets, and are given extra credit for cracking CIA codes as preparation for their futures in espionage services.

                    <p>Gillian Gallagher founded Gallagher Academy in 1865. Instead of calling it a "School for Women Spies," she discreetly called it a "finishing school for the most exceptional women of the time." Gillian had renovated her family mansion into a school after the government denied her entry to the Secret Service, though she prevented the first attempted assassination of Abraham Lincoln.</p>

                The Gallagher Girls series is a book series written by Ally Carter. The series follows Cameron Morgan, There are currently six books in the Gallagher Girls series. The sixth book, United We Spy, was published on September 5, 2013. Right now it looks like there isn't going to be a movie, but that could change, after much pestering from the fans Ally has revealed that she has and is trying to get somewhere graphic with her work, but for now we will have to wait. The series is suitable for teens ages 12+. There is no inappropriate language or sexually explicit scenes, though occasionally there is a bit of suggestiveness. Darker themes are introduced later in the series, especially in the fifth book (Out of Sight, Out of Time), but the only thing you really have to worry about is the state of your heart after you inevitably fall in love with one Zachary Goode.
                <p>Apart from the six main books in the series there are two short spinoffs, one called Double Crossed, in which Ally makes two worlds collide and the characters from her two most famed series meet; the other called A Gallagher Wedding, a short story available only online that happens in the timeline after the sixth book.</p>
                <p>Ally has recently announced the release of a new book for the series, Spies That Bind, that situates itself in the time when Cammie and her friends arrived at the Gallagher Academy, that will be out on June 25th</p>
